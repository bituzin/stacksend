## Overview

StackSend is a decentralized application built on the Stacks blockchain that allows users to send STX or SIP-010 fungible tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction. This saves time and reduces transaction fees compared to sending individual transfers.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multisend STX** | Send STX to up to 50 recipients at once |
| **Multisend FT** | Send any SIP-010 fungible token to multiple addresses |
| **Plan Tiers** | Starter (5), Pro (10), Max (20), Ultra (50) recipients per transaction |
| **Network Toggle** | Seamlessly switch between Mainnet and Testnet |
| **Auto Network Detection** | Automatically detects network from connected wallet |
| **Bulk Paste** | Quickly paste multiple addresses from a spreadsheet or list |
| **Dark/Light Mode** | Full theme support with system preference detection |
| **STX Input** | Enter amounts in STX (automatically converts to microSTX) |
| **Clarity 4** | Built with latest Stacks features for enhanced security |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Clarinet** v2+ ([Installation Guide](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/getting-started))
- **Stacks Wallet** (Leather or Xverse)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/winsznx/stacksend.git
cd stacksend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Mainnet contract address
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_MAINNET=SP31DP8F8CF2GXSZBHHHK5J6Y061744E1TNFGYWYV.multisend

# Testnet contract address
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_TESTNET=ST31DP8F8CF2GXSZBHHHK5J6Y061744E1TP7FRGHT.multisend
```

---

## Smart Contract

The Clarity smart contract powers all multisend operations securely on-chain.

### Contract Addresses

| Network | Contract Address |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Mainnet** | `SP31DP8F8CF2GXSZBHHHK5J6Y061744E1TNFGYWYV.multisend` |
| **Testnet** | `ST31DP8F8CF2GXSZBHHHK5J6Y061744E1TP7FRGHT.multisend` |

### Contract Functions

| Function | Description | Max Recipients |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `send-many-stx` | Batch STX transfers | 50 |
| `send-many-ft` | Batch FT transfers | 10 per call |
| `get-max-recipients` | Returns max allowed (50) | N/A |

### Clarity 4 Features

This contract utilizes Clarity 4's newest security features:

- **`restrict-assets?`** - Explicitly limits asset outflows for enhanced security
- **`contract-hash?`** - Verifies FT contracts exist before transfers
- **`with-stx`** - Declares maximum STX transfer limits

### Deploy Your Own Contract

```bash
# Validate contract syntax
clarinet check

# Deploy to Testnet
clarinet deployments generate --testnet --low-cost
clarinet deployments apply --testnet

# Deploy to Mainnet
clarinet deployments generate --mainnet --low-cost
clarinet deployments apply --mainnet
```

After deployment, update the contract addresses in your `.env` file.

## Usage Guide

### Connecting Your Wallet

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"** on the landing page
2. Select your wallet (Leather or Xverse)
3. Approve the connection request
4. The app automatically detects your network (Mainnet/Testnet)

### Sending STX to Multiple Recipients

1. Make sure **STX** tab is selected
2. Click **"Add Recipient"** or use **"Paste Addresses"** for bulk entry
3. Enter recipient addresses and amounts in STX (e.g., `0.001`)
4. Review the total amount
5. Click **"Send Transaction"**
6. Approve the transaction in your wallet

### Sending Fungible Tokens

1. Select the **"Fungible Token"** tab
2. Enter the token contract address (e.g., `SP...token-name`)
3. Add recipients and amounts
4. Send and approve the transaction

### Address Format

| Network | Address Prefix | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Mainnet | `SP` | `SP2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC` |
| Testnet | `ST` | `ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC` |

**Important:** Use addresses matching your selected network to avoid errors.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_MAINNET`
   - `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_TESTNET`
4. Deploy!

### Manual Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# Upload contents of dist/ to your hosting provider
```

---

## Security

- All transactions are signed client-side by your wallet
- Post-conditions prevent unexpected token transfers
- Contract uses Clarity 4's `restrict-assets?` for explicit security
- No private keys are ever stored or transmitted

---

## Troubleshooting

### "BadAddressVersionByte" Error

This means you're using addresses from the wrong network:
- **Testnet** requires addresses starting with `ST`
- **Mainnet** requires addresses starting with `SP`

### Transaction Failed

1. Check you have enough STX for the transaction + gas fees
2. Verify recipient addresses are valid
3. Ensure your wallet is on the correct network

### Wallet Not Connecting

1. Make sure you have Leather or Xverse installed
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check if your wallet is unlocked
